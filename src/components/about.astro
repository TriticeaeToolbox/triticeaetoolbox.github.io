    <p class="text-white! text-justify">The Triticeae Toolbox (T3) is the web portal for data generated initially by the Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (TriticeaeCAP), and now by WheatCAP.  T3 is funded by the National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). T3 contains DNA marker, phenotypic, and pedigree data from wheat, oat, and barley germplasm from public sector breeding programs across the United States. The purpose is to integrate rapidly expanding DNA marker and phenomic data with traditional phenotypic data, providing access to powerful joint predictive analyses mapping genotype to phenotype and enabling breeders to collaborate to accelerate gains from selection. T3 also links to related genomic and crop diversity databases (GrainGenes, Gramene, GRIN, and D2S) for functional analyses to identify causal polymorphisms and networks affecting phenotypes.</p>
