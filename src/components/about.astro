    <p class="text-white! text-justify">The Triticeae Toolbox (T3) is the webportal for the data generated by the Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP), funded by the National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). T3 contains SNP, phenotypic, and pedigree data from wheat and barley germplasm in the Triticeae CAP. The purpose is to integrate rapidly expanding DNA marker and sequence data with traditional phenotypic data to provide access to predictive analyses mapping genotype to phenotype and enabling breeders to select on marker data alone. T3 will also link to related genomic and crop diversity databases (GrainGenes, Gramene, PLEXdb, and GRIN) for functional analyses to identify causal polymorphisms and networks affecting phenotypes.</p>
